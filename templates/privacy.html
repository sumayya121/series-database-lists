    have requested, specifically to keep you logged in.</p>

<h2>3. The Information We Collect</h2>
{% if auth_provider == "Auth0" %}
<p>We collect limited personal information when you log in using Auth0, our third-party authentication provider:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>User ID:</strong> When you log in using Auth0 (which supports authentication via Google, GitHub, 
        or other identity providers), we receive and store your unique user ID from Auth0. This is a persistent 
        identifier that allows us to recognize you on subsequent visits.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Email Address:</strong> We receive your email address from Auth0 to identify your account.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Name:</strong> We may receive your name from Auth0 as provided by your chosen identity provider.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Session Data:</strong> We use a session cookie to maintain your logged-in status. This cookie
        stores a secure, random string (session ID) that links back to your user information on our server. The
        data is only stored for the duration of your visit (session).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>We <strong>do not</strong> collect additional personal details such as location, browsing history, 
    or any other information beyond what is necessary for authentication and service provision.</p>
{% else %}
<p>We collect very limited personal information when you log in using your GitHub account:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>GitHub User ID:</strong> When you log in using GitHub authentication, we retrieve your 
        user name and ID number and store only your unique user ID number. This is a persistent identifier 
        provided by GitHub.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Session Data:</strong> We use a session cookie to maintain your logged-in status. This cookie
        stores a secure, random string (session ID) that links back to your user ID & name on our server. The
        data is only stored for the duration of your visit (session).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>We <strong>do not</strong> collect your email address, profile picture, location, or any other personal 
    details unless explicitly stated here.</p>
{% endif %}

<h2>4. How We Use Your Information</h2>
<p>We use the collected information for the
    following purposes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Authentication:</strong> To verify your identity when you log in
        and to keep you securely logged in as you navigate the website.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Service Provision:</strong> To provide you with access to features and content available only
        to logged-in users.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Security:</strong> To enhance the security of our website and
        protect against unauthorised access.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>We do not use your information for marketing,
    analytics, or any other non-essential purpose.</p>

<h2>5. Third-Party Data Sharing</h2>
{% if auth_provider == "Auth0" %}
<p>We use third-party services for authentication and these services process your data:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Auth0 (by Okta):</strong> We use Auth0 as our authentication service provider. When you log in, 
        Auth0 handles the authentication process and provides us with your user ID, email, and name. Auth0 acts 
        as a data processor on our behalf. Auth0 may store additional information about your authentication sessions. 
        Please review the <a href="https://auth0.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Auth0 Privacy Policy</a> 
        for details on how they handle your data.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Identity Providers (Google, GitHub, etc.):</strong> When you choose to log in via Google, GitHub, 
        or another identity provider through Auth0, you interact with their services. These providers authenticate 
        your identity and share limited information with Auth0, which then shares it with us. Please review their 
        respective privacy policies:
        <ul></ul>
            <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub Privacy Statement</a></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>We do not share your information with any other third parties for marketing or other purposes.</p>
{% else %}
<p>We use a third-party service for authentication:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>GitHub:</strong> When you log in, you interact with GitHub's authentication service. 
        They provide us with your unique user ID and username. Please review the 
        <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub Privacy Statement</a> 
        for details on how they handle your data.
    </li>
</ul>
